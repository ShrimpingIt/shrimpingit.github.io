It is programmed using the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino IDE</a>, and thinks it's an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> but is much cheaper, and teaches more electronics fundamentals. You can use it in a <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/arduino-community/">whole world of projects</a>.</p><p>You make a Shrimp by pushing components into holes in a solderless breadboard. You can <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/bill-of-materials/">source them yourself</a> following our guide, or <a href="http://shrimping.it/blog/kits/">buy pre-bagged bundles</a> from us.</p><p>We use the 'Blink' build at the beginning of all our workshops, and when prototyping for ourselves, to prove that everything works before adding more challenging modules or behaviours. The minimal circuit can take 20 minutes or so when attempted the first time, plus troubleshooting if you didn't follow the instructions quite right.<br/>

A metal rail behind each 5-hole row grips the legs of inserted components, connecting them. Components in other rows above, below or across the gap remain separate.</p><p>A 400 tie-point solderless breadboard is shown, which has 'power rails', four full-height metal rails visible as columns down the sides. Although these holes are also grouped into 5, everything in each single column is connected to everything else inserted in that column. They are called power rails as they are usually wired to 5V (plus, or power) and 0V (minus, or ground), two connections which are used a lot throughout a typical circuit.</p><p>The Shrimp layout works on a mini-breadboard or soldered onto stripboard without changes.

It can break the legs if you force the chip in.

These have no orientation, each leg is the same as the other.</p><p>This ‘decoupling’ capacitor smooths electrical spikes, so that the reboot signal sent through to Pin 1 is stable and reliably detected. The chip should reboot only when you request it (e.g. when you’re reprogramming the microcontroller).</p><p>The digits 104 indicate capacitance in picoFarads using scientific notation. The last figure '4' tells us how many zeroes to add, so the capacitance starts ‘10’ and then continues with a further 4 zeroes - 100,000 picoFarads. Since 1 nanoFarad is 1000 picoFarads, there’s 100 nanoFarads in a capacitor marked ‘104’.<br/>

Resistors have no orientation, so you can't wire them backwards.</p><p>This will be used as a pull-up resistor. A positive voltage, usually 5V, ‘pulls up’ the reboot pin (Pin 1) through this resistor. The ATMEGA will keep running so long as it gets a high voltage on this pin. When reprogramming, the brown wire is briefly connected directly to 0V, (a stronger signal than the flow from 5V limited by the resistor). Pin 1 therefore gets pulled to 0V which causes the chip to reboot. After rebooting the ATMEGA listens for a new program sent over the orange wire. If nothing is sent, it runs the last program.</p><p>The colored stripes are decoded just like the '104' capacitor earlier, but colors are used instead of digits. Decoding the colors Brown=1, Black=0, Orange=3 gives us the number 103. That means the resistance in Ohms starts ‘10’ and continues with a further 3 zeroes - 10,000 Ohms or 10 kiloOhms.</p><p><strong><em>Attach the resistor with Brown, Black and Orange stripes between...</em></strong></p><ul>
