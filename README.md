This is a repository containing our static website resources (project overviews, build walkthroughs and teacher guides, providing Github Pages hosting for [start.shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it)). 

The full filesystem published here is generated from the [Website Text](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/website_text) repository then synchronized here, overwriting any previous content, so no authoring should take place in this repo.
